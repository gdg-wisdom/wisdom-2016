Every year, Google hosts developers around world in a software developer-focused conference held in San Francisco, California to showcase innovations in areas like Android mobile development, Modern front-end tools, infrastructure & DevOps, wearables, phones etc. 
Google I/O features highly technical, in-depth sessions focused on building web, mobile, and enterprise applications with Google and open web technologies such as Android, Chrome, Chrome OS, Google APIs, Google Web Toolkit, App Engine, and more.

To extend this to developers who are unable to attend the event on-site, and reach out to various communities, Google has created an initiative which helps augmenting this conference through various communities like the Google Developer Groups, Google Business Groups etc, titled as `Google I/O Extended` to different locations through interested organizers for the benefit of developers, students, start-up junkies around the world. I/O Extended events can be run in tandem with the actual I/O event, or can be run based on the timing that each local community feels suitable.
