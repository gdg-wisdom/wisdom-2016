# GDG Dev Fest

GDG DevFests are large, community-run events that can offer speaker sessions across multiple product areas, all-day hack-a-thons, code labs, and more. 

Generally, the official DevFest Season runs from *September 1st* through *November 30th* as of the year 2015. This is true for 2016 as well.

Each GDG DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community that hosts it. While no two events aspired to be exactly alike, each GDG DevFest , at its core, is powered by a shared belief that when developers come together to exchange ideas, amazing things can happen.

The invitation to host a GDG DevFest extends to active GDG chapters. GDG DevFests can be organized year round and are community run events. 

Therefore, these events take the form desired by the community with minimal guidelines. 
In order to ensure these events are bigger than regular GDG meetups though, there are a few recommendations:

- Duration of the event should be at least 5 hours
- Ideally more than 1 track if organizing a speaker session based event
- Hackathon - Ideally somewhere between 24-48 hours
