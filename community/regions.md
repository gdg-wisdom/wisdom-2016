# Regions

Each chapter is associated with one region. A _region_ represents a collection of chapters that have geographical connections to each other. A region typically spans countries, but in rare cases can be associated with a single country that has sufficient sub-regions (states, provinces) and chapters to make it worth viewing as a single entity.

At present, the following regions have been identified based primarily on the listing provided by the [GDG Reports App](http://gdg-report.appspot.com/).Each chapter has been associated with a 3-character code that may be used to identify or scope wisdom content that is relevant to that specific region.

 * CEU = Central & Eastern Europe
 * CEN = Central & Eastern Europe, North
 * CAS = Central Asia
 * MEA = Middle East, North Africa & Turkey
 * NDC = Nordics
 * NAM = North America
 * NEA = North-East Asia
 * SEA = South-East Asia
 * LAM = Spanish-Speaking Latin America
 * SSA = Sub-Saharan Africa
 * WEU = Western Europe

Each region is described below in more detail. The current identification of countries in a region is again based on the [GDG Reports App](http://gdg-report.appspot.com/) classification (_select the Meeting stats link, and the region, to see chapter listings_). Current data is based on the *2015Q4* stats.
