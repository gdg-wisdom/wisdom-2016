## Check your chapter's number by Jackie Han
A page to help you understand the size of your events in the past:

See also [the analyzing section](/what_is_a_gdg/analyzing.html).

## Statistics about using your event's short url
For each GDG event, the firefly project (http://gdg.events) creates a short url that tracks which users have used the link. You find the statistics at the firefly url appending `analytics`, e.g. gdg.events/78dd40/analytics for GDG DevFest Berlin.
