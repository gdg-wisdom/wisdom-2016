# Coding For Kids
This section is for capturing resources, curriculum and ideas for teaching programming to kids aged 3-12 years or so. We hope to collect information around *tools*, *curriculum*, *events* and *projects* that the GDG community can use, to promote early CS education.

## Tools
These are some of the tools you can use to run a programming or coding lab.

* [Scratch from MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
* [Lego WeDo](https://education.lego.com/en-us/preschool-and-school/lower-primary/7plus-education-wedo)
* [Lego Mindstorms](http://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/?domainredir=mindstorms.lego.com)
* [Tynker](https://www.tynker.com/)
* [Makey Makey](http://www.makeymakey.com/)
* [MIT App Inventor](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/)


## Resources
These are some resources that you can refer to for help/advice.

* [Made With Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/)
* [Code.org](http://code.org)
* [Google For Education](https://www.google.com/edu/)

You can also work with the following organizations to start coding clubs in your area. Some of these organizations may be specific to a region, or supported by local institutions. Check with the site for more information.
* [CS First](http://www.cs-first.com/)
* [Coder Dojo](http://coderdojo.com/)


## Curriculum
This section will document curriculum resources for coding with kids. Curriculum refers to a progressive series of projects or lessons that can be used to iteratively build a child's expertise on a topic.
* [Scratch Curriculum from Harvard](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/)
* [Scratch Curriculum from CS-First](http://www.cs-first.com/materials)

## Events
These are links to events that are held on a regular basis, with a specific focus on coding for kids
* [Scratch Day](http://day.scratch.mit.edu/) - hands on activities and competition with Scratch projects
* [Hour Of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) - a co-ordinated jumpstart for teaching coding to schools or small communities

## People
Use this section to identify people who are currently exploring ideas in this space, or working on projects/events. The idea is to find experts to provide guidance

## Projects
Use this section to reference any projects built by GDG community members, that is relevant to this topic. Open source projects (with links to a GitHub repo or Google Drive documentation) are *particularly* appreciated.
* TBD
