# GDG Chapters

## What is GDG?

Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from the [Android](http://code.google.com/android), [App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), and [Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/chrome/) platforms, to product APIs like the [Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/) and [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/).

A GDG can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch our [latest video](http://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers), to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on developers and technical content, and the core audience should be developers.

##A GDG is

* A place to learn about [Google Technologies and Tools](https://developers.google.com/products/) for developers.
* A place to see what local companies and developers are doing with these technologies
* Focused on developers and educational technical content
* Open to the public with a public membership
* A place to meet cool and smart people in tech :)

##A GDG is NOT...

* Run by a corporation
* A place to hear a very salesy pitch at any time
* Focused on end users or consumer content
* A closed group

## What are the benefits of joining a GDG ?

The GDG is an initiative formed out of passion and goodwill. There are no direct monetary or material benefits, except the occasional Google merchandise. However, the long-term benefits are many.

* Learn about interesting technologies.
* Connect with other developers in the region.
* Offers a platform to discuss and share, through talks, seminars, etc.
* Be recognised in the developer community.
* Mentorship opportunities from senior developers in the community.
* Network with Google’s speakers during events.
* Does not consume much time.

## What are the benefits of organizing a GDG?

If you love internet technologies and enjoy exploring them with others, you’ll love being involved in a chapter or even being its founder. You’ll be able to bring together great speakers and like-minded audience and do things together that YOU personally like to do, but on a larger scale and with your direct influence on what that will be. While you could of course do this yourself anytime, the association with GDG brings you personally closer to the Google world, helps you in promoting and running your events and will let you get inspiration from more than 500 other GDG organizers around the world. You will also learn a lot yourself - from organizing and leading people, through running events to growing your technical knowledge. The GDG leadership position isn’t paid, but it lets you get a lot of other benefits. And it looks darn good on résumés, too.
